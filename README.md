# JSlither
An open source nodejs server implementation for slither.io




### Requirements
1. make sure you have `nodejs` installed.
2. install dependencies: `npm install`

### Running the server

1. start the server with: `npm start`
2. go to http://slither.io
3. paste in browser console: `sos = [{ip: "your.ip.adress", po: yourPortNumber, ac: 132, ptm: 12}];`
4. click on play


Currently, the server is in a very early stage. Just a few packets are implemented. A real gameplay is actually not done.
